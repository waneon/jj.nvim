## Enhanced integrations

Here are some cool features you can do with jj.nvim:

### View change summary from the log buffer

Quickly preview the files changed in any revision without leaving the log:

- `<S-k>` - Show a tooltip with the revision's changed files
- `<S-k>` - To enter the tooltip buffer

From the summary view, you can:

- `<S-d>` - Diff the file under cursor at that revision
- `<CR>` - Edit the revision and open the file
- `<S-CR>` - Edit the revision (ignoring immutability) and open the file

![Summary-from-log](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/summary.gif)

### Diff any change

You can diff any change in your log history by pressing `<S-d>` on its line or on a summary file change. You can also visually select multiple changes to diff between the first and last selected.

> [!NOTE]
> Integrates with your preferred diff plugin or uses your native jj diff config. See [Diff Module](#diff-module).

![Diff-from-log](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/diff-log.gif)

### Describe a change

You can describe any change directly from the log buffer:

- `d` - Describe the revision under cursor using your configured editor

### Edit changes

Jumping up and down your log history ?

In your log output press `CR` in a line to directly edit a `mutable` change.
If you are sure what you are doing press `S-CR` (Shift Enter) to edit an `immutable` change.
![Edit-from-log](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/edit-log.gif)

### Create new changes from the log buffer

You can create new changes directly from the log buffer with multiple options:

- `n` - Create a new change branching off the revision under the cursor
- `<C-n>` - Create a new change after the revision under the cursor
- `<S-n>` - Create a new change after while ignoring immutability constraints

### Undo/Redo from the log buffer

You can undo/redo changes directly from the log buffer:

- `<S-u>` - Undo the last operation
- `<S-r>` - Redo the last undone operation

### Abandon changes from the log buffer

You can abandon changes directly from the log buffer, works in visual mode to abandon multiple changes:

- `a` - Abandon the revision under the cursor

### Fetch and push from the log buffer

You can fetch and push directly from the log buffer:

- `f` - Fetch from remote
- `<S-p>` - Push a bookmark through the picker
- `p` - Push bookmark of revision under cursor to remote

### Manage bookmarks from the log buffer

- `b` - Create a new bookmark or move an existing one to the revision under cursor
  - Select from existing bookmarks to move them
  - Or create a new bookmark at that revision

### Squash changes from the log buffer

Enter an interactive squash mode to squash one or more changes into a destination:

- `s` - Enter squash mode targeting the revision under cursor (in normal mode) or selected revisions (in visual mode)
- `<S-s>` - Quick squash the revision under cursor into its parent

Once in squash mode, the interface highlights your selection and the current squash destination:

- Selected changes are highlighted in your configured `selected_hl` color (default: dark magenta)
- The cursor position (potential squash destination) is highlighted in your configured `targeted_hl` color (default: green)
- Move the cursor to preview different squash destinations with live highlighting

From squash mode, choose how to squash:

- `<CR>` - Squash into (`-t`) the revision under cursor
- `<S-CR>` - Squash into (`-t`) ignoring immutability
- `<Esc>` or `<C-c>` - Exit squash mode without making changes

**Visual mode selection:** Select multiple revisions in visual mode before pressing `s` to squash them all at once. The plugin extracts each selected revision and squashes them together.

**Quick squash:** In normal mode, press `<S-s>` to quickly squash the current revision into its parent. This ignores immutability.

![Squash-from-log](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/squash.gif)

### Split changes from the log buffer

Split a change into two or more revisions directly from the log buffer or the command line:

- `<C-s>` - Split the revision under cursor from the log buffer

The split command opens an interactive floating terminal where jj guides you through selecting which changes go into the first commit. The remaining changes stay in the second commit.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use something like [hunk.nvim](https://github.com/julienvincent/hunk.nvim), simply follow the steps and update your jj's config to use it as a tool and a neovim instance with hunk will be ran inside your current neovim, for a seamless integration
>
> Other tools that ran in the terminal like jj's native should work out of the box too.

**Via `:J` command:**

```sh
:J split              " Split @ interactively
:J split abc123       " Split a specific revision
:J split @ --parallel " Create parallel changes instead of sequential
:J split @ --message "first half" " Set a commit message for the first split
```

**Via Lua API:**

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.split()                                      -- Split @ interactively
cmd.split({ rev = "abc123" })                    -- Split a specific revision
cmd.split({ parallel = true })                   -- Create parallel changes
cmd.split({ message = "first half" })            -- Set message for first split
cmd.split({ filesets = { "src/" } })             -- Only include specific filesets
cmd.split({ ignore_immutable = true })           -- Split an immutable revision
```

The floating terminal size is configurable via the `split.width` and `split.height` options (ratios between `0.1` and `1.0`).

### Rebase changes from the log buffer

Enter an interactive rebase mode directly from the log buffer to rebase one or more changes:

- `r` - Enter rebase mode targeting the revision under cursor (in normal mode) or selected revisions (in visual mode)

Once in rebase mode, the interface highlights your selection and the current rebase destination:

- Selected changes are highlighted in your configured `selected_hl` color (default: dark magenta)
- The cursor position (potential rebase destination) is highlighted in your configured `targeted_hl` color (default: green)
- Move the cursor to preview different rebase destinations with live highlighting

From rebase mode, choose how to rebase:

- `<CR>` or `o` - Rebase onto (`-o`) the revision under cursor
- `a` - Rebase after (`-A`) the revision under cursor
- `b` - Rebase before (`-B`) the revision under cursor
- `<S-CR>` or `<S-o>` - Rebase onto (`-o`) ignoring immutability
- `<S-a>` - Rebase after (`-A`) ignoring immutability
- `<S-b>` - Rebase before (`-B`) ignoring immutability
- `<Esc>` or `<C-c>` - Exit rebase mode without making changes

**Visual mode selection:** Select multiple revisions in visual mode before pressing `r` to rebase them all at once. The plugin extracts each selected revision and rebases them together.

**Single revision:** In normal mode, place your cursor on a single revision and press `r` to rebase just that change.

![Rebase-from-log](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/rebase.gif)

### Open a PR/MR from the log buffer

- `o` - Open a PR/MR for the revision under cursor
- `<S-o>` - Select a remote from all available bookmarks and open a PR/MR

The plugin automatically:

- Extracts the bookmark from the revision
- Detects your git platform (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, Forgejo, etc.)
- Constructs the appropriate PR/MR URL
- Handles both HTTPS and SSH remote URLs
- Prompts you to select a remote if you have multiple

**This is a jj.nvim exclusive feature** - the ability to seamlessly bridge from your Neovim jj workflow directly to your remote platform's PR/MR interface.

### Open a changed file

Just press enter to open a file from the `status` output in your current window.
![Open-status](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/enter-status.gif)

### Restore a changed file

Press `<S-x>` on a file from the `status` output and that's it, it's restored.

![Restore-status](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/x-status.gif)

## Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

Using the latest stable release:

```lua
{
    "nicolasgb/jj.nvim",
    version = "*", -- Use latest stable release
    -- Or from the main branch (uncomment the branch line and comment the version line)
    -- branch = "main",
    config = function()
        require("jj").setup({})
    end,
}
```

## Cmdline Usage

The plugin provides a `:J` command that accepts jj subcommands:

```sh
:J status
:J log
:J describe "Your change description"
:J new
:J push               " Push all changes
:J push main         " Push only main bookmark
:J fetch             " Fetch from remote
:J open_pr           " Open PR for current change's bookmark
:J open_pr --list    " Select bookmark from all and open PR
:J split             " Split a change interactively
:J bookmark create/move/delete
:J # This will use your defined default command
:J <your-alias>
:J commit            " Opens your configured editor describes @ and then creates a new change -A immediately
:J commit <any text here> " Automatically describes @ and creates a new change -A immediately
```

### Diff Commands

The plugin also provides `:Jdiff`, `:Jvdiff`, and `:Jhdiff` commands for diffing against specific revisions:

```sh
:Jdiff              " Vertical diff against @- (parent)
:Jdiff @-2          " Vertical diff against specific revision
:Jvdiff main        " Vertical diff against main bookmark
:Jhdiff trunk()     " Horizontal diff against trunk
```

        }
      }
    },

    -- Configure log command behavior
    log = {

      },
      -- Close keymaps (shared across all buffers)
      close = { "q", "<Esc>" },
    },

}}

```

### Describe Editor Modes

The `describe.editor.type` option lets you choose how you want to write commit descriptions:

- **`"buffer"`** (default) - Opens a full buffer editor similar to Git's commit message editor
  - Shows file changes with syntax highlighting
  - Multi-line editing with proper formatting
  - Close with `<C-c>`, save with `q` or `:wq`
- **`"input"`** - Simple single-line input prompt
  - Quick and minimal
  - Good for short, single-line descriptions
  - Uses `vim.ui.input()` which can be customized by UI plugins like dressing.nvim

Example:

```lua
require("jj").setup({
  describe = {
    editor = {
      type = "input", -- Use simple input mode
    }
  }
})
```

You can also customize the keymaps for the describe editor buffer:

```lua
require("jj").setup({
  describe = {
    editor = {
      type = "buffer",
      keymaps = {
        close = { "<C-c>" }, -- Close without saving
        save = { "q" },               -- Write and close
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Highlight Customization

The `highlights` option allows you to customize the colors used in the describe buffer's file status display. Each highlight accepts standard Neovim highlight attributes:

- `fg` - Foreground color (hex or color name)
- `bg` - Background color
- `ctermfg` - Terminal foreground color
- `ctermbg` - Terminal background color
- `bold`, `italic`, `underline` - Text styles

Example with custom colors:

```lua
require("jj").setup({
  highlights = {
    modified = { fg = "#89ddff", bold = true },
    added = { fg = "#c3e88d", ctermfg = "LightGreen" },
  }
})
```

## Lua API Usage

Beyond the `:J` command, you can call functions directly from Lua for more control. The example config below shows how to use them with custom keymaps.

### Log Command Options

The `log` function accepts an options table:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.log({
  summary = false,      -- Show summary of changes (default: false)
  reversed = false,     -- Reverse the log order (default: false)
  no_graph = false,     -- Hide the graph (default: false)
  limit = 20,          -- Limit number of entries (default: 20)
  revisions = "'all()'" -- Revision specifier (default: all reachable)
})

-- Examples:
cmd.log({ limit = 50 })                    -- Show 50 entries
cmd.log({ revisions = "'main::@'" })       -- Show commits between main and current
cmd.log({ summary = true, limit = 100 })   -- Show summary with high limit
cmd.log({ raw = "-r 'main::@' --summary --no-graph" }) -- Pass raw flags directly
```

## Configuration Examples

### New Command Options

The `new` function accepts an options table:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.new({
  show_log = false,     -- Display log after creating new change (default: false)
  with_input = false,   -- Prompt for parent revision (default: false)
  args = ""             -- Additional arguments to pass to jj new
})

-- Examples:
cmd.new({ show_log = true })                           -- Create new and show log
cmd.new({ show_log = true, with_input = true })        -- Prompt for parent
cmd.new({ args = "--before @" })                       -- Pass custom args
```

### Push Command Options

The `push` function accepts an options table:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.push({
  bookmark = "main"     -- Push specific bookmark (default: all changes)
})

-- Examples:
cmd.push()                    -- Push all changes
cmd.push({ bookmark = "main" }) -- Push only main bookmark
cmd.push({ bookmark = "feature" }) -- Push only feature bookmark
```

### Bookmark Management Command Options

The `bookmark_create` function creates a new bookmark:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.bookmark_create()                               -- Prompts for bookmark name, then prompts the revision
cmd.bookmark_create({ prefix = "feature/" })        -- Uses prefix for default bookmark name
```

You can also set a default bookmark prefix in the config:

```lua
require("jj").setup({
  cmd = {
    bookmark = {
      prefix = "feature/"  -- Default prefix when creating bookmarks
    }
  }
})
```

The `bookmark_move` function moves an existing bookmark to a new revision:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.bookmark_move()  -- Select bookmark, then specify new revset
```

The `bookmark_delete` function deletes a bookmark:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.bookmark_delete()  -- Select bookmark to delete
```

### Open PR/MR Command Options

The `open_pr` function accepts an options table:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.open_pr({
  list_bookmarks = false    -- Whether to select from all bookmarks (default: false, uses current revision)
})

-- Examples:
cmd.open_pr()                          -- Open PR for current change's bookmark
cmd.open_pr({ list_bookmarks = true }) -- Select bookmark from all and open PR
```

### Diff Module

The diff module provides a unified API for viewing diffs with pluggable backend support.

The natively supported backends are:

- Native (Diffs the current file in place and uses a floating buffer with your jj diff command when diffing changes)
- [codediff](https://github.com/esmuellert/codediff.nvim)
- [diffview](https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim)

#### Functions

```lua
local diff = require("jj.diff")

-- Diff current buffer against a revision (default: @-)
-- The `layout` is only supported for the native backend
diff.diff_current({ rev = "@-", layout = "vertical" })

-- Show what changed in a single revision
diff.show_revision({ rev = "abc123" })

-- Diff between two revisions
diff.diff_revisions({ left = "main", right = "@" })

-- Convenience functions (LEGACY FUNCTIONS)
diff.open_vdiff()                   -- Vertical split diff against parent
diff.open_vdiff({ rev = "main" })   -- Vertical split against specific revision
diff.open_hdiff()                   -- Horizontal split diff
diff.open_hdiff({ rev = "@-2" })    -- Horizontal split against @-2
```

#### Log Buffer Integration

The diff module integrates seamlessly with the log buffer:

- `<S-d>` - Show diff for the revision under cursor in a floating window

These actions use the configured diff backend, allowing you to leverage your preferred diff viewer directly from the log.

### Custom Diff Backends

The diff module supports pluggable backends. Built-in backends include `native`, `diffview`, and `codediff`. You can register your own backend:

```lua
local diff = require("jj.diff")

diff.register_backend("my-backend", {
  -- Diff current buffer against a revision
  diff_current = function(opts)
    -- opts.rev: revision to diff against (default: "@-")
    -- opts.path: file path (default: current buffer)
    -- opts.layout: "vertical" or "horizontal"
  end,

  -- Show what changed in a single revision
  show_revision = function(opts)
    -- opts.rev: revision to show
    -- opts.path: optional file filter
    -- opts.display: "floating", "tab", or "split"
  end,

  -- Diff between two revisions
  diff_revisions = function(opts)
    -- opts.left: left/base revision
    -- opts.right: right/target revision
    -- opts.path: optional file filter
    -- opts.display: "floating", "tab", or "split"
  end,
})
```

Set your backend as default in the config:

```lua
require("jj").setup({
  diff = {
    backend = "my-backend"
  }
})
```

Or use it per-call:

```lua
diff.diff_current({ backend = "my-backend", rev = "main" })
```

All three functions are optional—missing ones fall back to the `native` implementation.

### Annotations

View file blame and line history using the annotate module. Can be invoked via command or Lua API.

**Via `:J` command:**

```sh
:J annotate         " Show blame/annotations for entire file in vertical split
:J annotate_line    " Show annotation for current line in floating buffer
```

**Via Lua API:**

```lua
local annotate = require("jj.annotate")
annotate.file()    -- Show blame/annotations for entire file in vertical split
annotate.line()    -- Show annotation for current line in a tooltip
```

The file annotation displays a vertical split showing:

- Change ID (colored uniquely per commit)
- Author name
- Timestamp

Press `<CR>` on any annotation line to view the diff for that change.

The line annotation displays a floating tooltip with the current line's annotation and the commit description.

Example keymaps:

```lua
local annotate = require("jj.annotate")
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>ja", annotate.file, { desc = "JJ annotate file" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>jA", annotate.line, { desc = "JJ annotate line" })
```

## Example config

```lua

{
  "nicolasgb/jj.nvim",
  dependencies = {
    "folke/snacks.nvim", -- Optional, only needed if you use pickers

    -- One of these two if you want to use them as your diff backend
    "esmuellert/codediff.nvim",
    "sindrets/diffview.nvim",
  },

  config = function()
    local jj = require("jj")
    jj.setup({
      terminal = {
        cursor_render_delay = 10, -- Adjust if cursor position isn't restoring correctly
      },
      diff = {
          backend = "codediff"
      },
      cmd = {
        describe = {
          editor = {
            type = "buffer",

              save = { "q" },
            }
          }
        },
        bookmark = {
            prefix = "feat/"
        },
        keymaps = {
          log = {
            checkout = "<CR>",
            describe = "d",
            diff = "<S-d>",
            abandon = "<S-a>",
            fetch = "<S-f>",
          },
          status = {
            open_file = "<CR>",
            restore_file = "<S-x>",
          },
          close = { "q", "<Esc>" },
        },
      },
      highlights = {
        -- Customize colors if desired
        modified = { fg = "#89ddff" },
      }
    })
